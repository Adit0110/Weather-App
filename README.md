# Weather-App

This is a simple Weather App built using HTML, CSS, Node.js, and JSON. The app fetches real-time weather data based on the user's input and displays it in an easy-to-read format.

## Features

- **Real-time Weather Data:** Get accurate and up-to-date weather information.
- **City-based Search:** Enter any city name to fetch the current weather details.
- **Responsive UI:** The app is styled with CSS for a clean and responsive design.
- **JSON Data Handling:** The weather data is retrieved and processed in JSON format.
- **Node.js Backend:** The app is powered by a Node.js server to handle API requests and responses.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the app's front-end.
- **CSS3**: For styling the user interface.
- **Node.js**: For server-side functionality and API integration.
- **JSON**: For fetching and displaying weather data.

## How It Works

1. The user enters the name of a city.
2. The app sends a request to a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) using Node.js.
3. The server processes the request and returns the weather data in JSON format.
4. The app displays the weather details, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
